## test

Thee governance system in EdenSwap implements a manager-based approach, where a designated manager address holds the authority to control critical protocol parameters. This centralized yet controlled governance model ensures efficient decision-making while maintaining protocol security. The manager can adjust key parameters such as the DAO fee rate, pool multipliers, and emergency controls. The system implements strict access controls and parameter constraints to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure protocol stability.
